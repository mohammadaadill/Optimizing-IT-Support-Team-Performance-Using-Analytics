# Internship Learning Documentation

## 📌 Core Concepts Covered

### Categories of Data Analysis
- **Descriptive Analysis** – Understanding what happened using historical data.  
- **Diagnostic Thinking** – Identifying patterns, outliers, and performance gaps.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding data structure before visualization.  

👉 Key takeaway: Dashboards should not just display charts but should answer business questions.

---

### Types of Data
- **Categorical Data** – Used for grouping (Priority, Assignment Group).  
- **Numerical Data** – Used for calculations (Ticket counts, Severity levels).  
- **Time-Based Data** – Used to analyze trends over months or days.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

### Python & Power Query
Data cleaning was performed using both **Python (Pandas)** and **Power BI Power Query**.

Key tasks included:
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicates  
- Fixing incorrect formats  
- Cleaning string values inside numeric columns  
- Detecting and handling outliers  
- Structuring datasets for analysis  

Workflow followed: **Transfer → Clean → Visualize → Structure**

## 📊 Power BI Fundamentals

### Three Main Views
- **Report View** – Building visual dashboards.  
- **Data View** – Inspecting tables and columns.  
- **Model View** – Managing relationships and schema.  

### Data Modeling Concepts
- Fact Tables & Dimension Tables  
- Star Schema & Snowflake Schema  
- Primary Key & Foreign Key relationships  
- One-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships  

👉 Understanding data modeling improved DAX calculations and dashboard performance.

## 🎨 Data Visualization Principles
Different charts were used depending on the data type:
- **Bar Charts** → Category comparison with precision  
- **Pie Charts** → Proportion visualization (used carefully)  
- **Line Charts** → Time-based trends  
- **KPI Cards** → Highlight key performance indicators  

We also discussed when **NOT** to use certain charts to avoid misleading insights.

## 🧮 DAX & Measures
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was introduced as the calculation engine of Power BI.

Concepts covered:
- Measures vs Columns  
- CALCULATE function  
- Conditional logic using IF  
- KPI calculations  
- Impact of data modeling on DAX queries  

---

## 🔎 Interactivity & Filtering
Slicers were used to make dashboards dynamic and allow users to explore data through:
- Priority filters  
- Resolution categories  
- Assignment group selection  

---

## 🌐 Live Data & Real-World Context
The internship included discussions on:
- Live data import challenges  
- APIs and web data sources  
- Zendesk ticketing workflows  
- Dummy vs Synthetic data  
- Power BI Premium concepts  

---

## 💡 Personal Learning & Improvement
Throughout the internship, significant improvement was made in:
- Power Query transformations  
- Power BI modeling  
- Dashboard storytelling  
- Structuring GitHub repositories  
- Converting raw data into analytical insights  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Covered
- Power BI  
- Power Query  
- Python  
- Pandas  
- GitHub  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📌 Summary
This internship provided hands-on experience in transforming raw IT support data into a structured analytical solution.  
The focus was not only on creating dashboards but also on understanding **data modeling, visualization best practices, and real-world analytics workflows**.
